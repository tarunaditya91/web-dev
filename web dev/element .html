         you want to become the very best writer you can be, if you want your writing to find its audience, join the low-residency MFA in Creative Writing at Fairleigh Dickinson University. Over the past five years, our students and alumni have published 28 book-length works of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, young adult literature, and translation. These publications include a New York Times bestseller, the winner of the African American Book Prize, and the Colorado Book Prize for Biography. Our students and alumni have published hundreds of poems, stories, essays, and translations in prestigious literary magazines. Most of our students begin to publish while they are still in the program. Because of our proximity to New York City— the heart of the publishing world—we are able to introduce students to editors, agents, and publishers.

Follow our alumni successes on our Instagram and Twitter accounts. FDU is the only low-residency MFA program that offers the chance to work on the editorial staff of The Literary Review, an international literary quarterly with an illustrious 60-year history. 

The residency in Wroxton, England provides the chance to meet writers from the United Kingdom. You can explore nearby Oxford and London, while immersing yourself in writing and study at FDU’s 17th-century Jacobean country mansion.

We offer concentrations in Fiction, Creative Nonfiction, Writing for Young Adults and Children, Poetry, and Literary Translation. We also offer the option of combining two genres in the completion of an MFA degree with a dual concentration.

Our MFA program is ideal for students who want a more flexible academic schedule; with our twice-a-year residencies in Wroxton, England and Madison, New Jersey, you don’t have to interrupt family or work life in order to pursue your writing in a rigorous way, and you’ll be studying with mentors who are not only acclaimed, award-winning writers, but devoted teachers.  FDU’s MFA Program offers several scholarships and assistantships. As our alumni will attest, this MFA program is not only a vibrant and nurturing literary community. It is a gateway to change. We believe that as you grow as a writer, you expand as a human being.
